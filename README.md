## About 
### The project 

    - In this project, we worked with real-life data provided  by [AZ Direct](https://www.az-direct.com/site/en/company/) and [Arvato Finance Solution](https://finance.arvato.com/en/).
    
    - The data concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population
       that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign.
    - The aim of this project is use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters,
      then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
